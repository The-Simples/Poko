# Multiplay
## [Step-up](https://rewrite.modrinth.com/mod/stepup)
The mod is client side and should work with vanilla servers as well, except if the server has some code to prevent the mod from working. Because of this, the mod saves its configuration per server, so you can turn it on wherever it works without hampering servers where it doesn't.

Modes can be switched using the ++j++ key at any time; the key can be changed in options as usual.

## [Inspecio](https://modrinth.com/mod/inspecio)
In some use cases, tooltips take much more space that make no senses.

You can use the command `/inspecio config` to manage configuration.

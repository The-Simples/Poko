#### [Presence Footsteps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/presence-footsteps)
Expect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new 
and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material 
assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.

#### [Effective](https://github.com/ladysnake/effective) -- Ambient and environmental interaction effects
Effective is a client-side Fabric mod that adds various visual and auditory effects lacking in 
Vanilla Minecraft to improve overall ambience and feel of the game. Currently, it adds 
water and lava splashes to entities falling in liquids, as well as cascade visual and sound effects.

#### [Illuminations](https://github.com/Ladysnake/Illuminations) -- Ambient particles
Illuminations is a client sided Minecraft Fabric mod that adds multiple ambient particles in order to 
make your world more enjoyable at night or in dark places.

#### [Not Enough Animations](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/not-enough-animations) -- Third-person animations
This mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to 
be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person. This mod 
was created as an expansion for the First-Person Mod, but works completely on its own and is fully 
vanilla/3rd party server compatible(since it's all just visual).
